# map

Map lines from stdin to commands.

Description
-----------

Map lets you process each line from stdin with a command of your
choice. For example:

```console
$ ls
LICENSE   README.md makefile  map.1   map.c
```

```console
$ ls | map 'echo $f $f'
LICENSE LICENSE
README.md README.md
makefile makefile
map.1 map.1
map.c map.c
```

By default, the value of each line is set to a variable named 'f'.
To change this, just include the variable name as the first parameter:

```console
$ ls | map myvarname 'echo $myvarname $myvarname'
LICENSE LICENSE
README.md README.md
makefile makefile
map.1 map.1
map.c map.c
```

Note that the command must be wrapped in single quotes to prevent
the variable from being expanded by the shell.

Installation
------------

Install map into `/usr/local/bin` with the following command:

```console
$ make install
```

You can use `make PREFIX=/some/other/directory install` if you wish
to use a different destination. If you want to remove map from
your system, use `make uninstall`.

Motivation
----------

There are many ways to accomplish what you can do with `map`,
including `find`, `xargs`, `awk`, and shell for-loops. The approach
taken by `map` is extremely pragmatic and allows me to express
concisely what I want. Given the fact that it's designed as a filter,
it can operate on any kind of list, not only lists of files.

The problem that prompted me to think about `map` was the following:
given a list of files, I wanted to execute two commands on each.
Here's how you can do it with different tools:

With `map`:

```sh
ls *.c | map 'foo $f; bar $f'
```

With `xargs`:

```sh
ls *.c | xargs -I % sh -c 'foo %; bar %;'
```

With `awk`:

```sh
ls *.c | awk '{ system("foo "$0"; bar "$0) }'
```

With `find`:

```sh
find . -name \*.c -maxdepth 1 -exec foo {} \; -exec bar {} \;
```

With a `bash` for-loop:

```bash
for f in $(ls *.c)
do
  foo $f
  bar $f
done
```

With a `csh` for-loop:

```sh
foreach f (*.c)
  foo $f
  bar $f
end
```

Map's modest claim is that it improves on the ergonomics of existing
tools. It's not only that sometimes it allows you to type less, but
also the conceptual model needed to operate it is simpler.

Let's consider these tasks:

1. Execute a command `foo` on each C file:

```sh
ls *.c | map 'foo $f'
```

```sh
ls *.c | xargs foo
```

```sh
find . -name *.c -maxdepth 1 -exec foo {} \;
```

2. Execute commands `foo` and `bar` on each C file:

```sh
ls *.c | map 'foo $f; bar $f'
```

```sh
ls *.c | xargs -I % sh -c 'foo %; bar %;'
```

```sh
find . -name *.c -maxdepth 1 -exec foo {} \; -exec bar {} \;
```

3. Download files from a list of URLs in a file:

```sh
cat urls | map 'curl -O $f'
```

```sh
cat urls | xargs -n 1 curl -O
```

4. Sleep three times for one second and say "done" after each elapsed
   second:

```sh
printf "1\n1\n1\n" | map 'sleep $f && say done'
```

```sh
printf "1\n1\n1\n" | xargs -n 1 -I % sh -c 'sleep % && say done'
```

5. Same as #4, but run the commands in parallel:

```sh
printf "1\n1\n1\n" | map 'sleep $f && say done &'
```

```sh
printf "1\n1\n1\n" | xargs -n 1 -P 3 -I % sh -c 'sleep % && say done'
```

The last three examples are not possible with `find`, because it
only operates on file hierarchies.

When using `map`, the commands don't vary much because the command
argument is a template for a well known syntax. On the other hand,
there's more variation in the invocations to `xargs` and `find`,
which means you may need to remember those command line options if
you want an idiomatic solution.

As with anything in life, familiarity helps and if you use a tool
in a certain way over and over it will seem simple to operate, but
we can still analyze the conceptual models and determine how much
information is needed in each case. I would say the advantage of
`map` is that it requires less knowledge.
 
Of course `xargs` and `find` are much larger tools, with a bigger
feature set. Map has around 20 lines of code. For comparison, here's
the [source code of GNU xargs][xargs]. No doubt `xargs` will offer
a lot more features, but so far with `map` I've completely stopped
using `xargs` and for-loops. Another way to think about `map` vs
`xargs`: if `map` had been specified in POSIX and `xargs` was just
released, I'm not sure I would install it unless `map` proved to
be unfit for a given use case.

Something important to keep in mind is that `map` works on lines,
not on files. My reasoning was that in the context of a POSIX
environment, a map function can be expected to filter lines from
stdin. In that regard, it is very generic because a line can represent
anything.

Known issues
------------

In the examples above I frequently use the output of `ls`. In my
projects, filenames don't contain spaces, newlines, or other special
characters because I find them inconvenient, even though they are
valid. As `map` works on lines, filenames that contain newlines
should be handled separately. For files that contain whitespace,
the common solution is to wrap the variable in double quotes, so
instead of `$f` you would use `"$f"`.
